### Attempt any two questions: (2 x 10 = 20)

1. Trace out Infix to Postfix conversion algorithm with given Infix expression.\
   A + (((B-C) \* (D-E) + F)/G) $ (H-I)\
   Evaluate the postfix expression acquired from above for the given values:\
   A = 6, B = 2, C = 4, D = 3, E = 8, F = 2, G = 3, H = 5, I = 1.
